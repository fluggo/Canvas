Rules for GL usage
==================

Later versions of OpenGL do not allow the client to save the current state of the
GL, so certain expectations need to be met on the state of things between GL
routines.

The default state, and the one that should be there at the end of any GL routine,
is:

    glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0 );
    glActiveTexture( GL_TEXTURE0 );
    glUseProgramObjectARB( 0 );
    glBindFramebufferEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT, 0 );
    glDisable( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB );
    glBindTexture( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB, 0 );
